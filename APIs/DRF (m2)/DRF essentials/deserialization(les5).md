# üìë Deserialization & Validation

## üí° Deserialization
Deserialization is the process of converting data received from the client (often in JSON format) back into Python objects. It also includes **validating** the data to ensure it adheres to the required structure and rules.

## üí° Validation 
Validation is the process of checking whether the deserialized data is correct and meets the expected format, constraints, and rules.

## ‚úÖ Steps to Validate Data Using Deserialization

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pass the Request to a Serializer  
The serializer takes the incoming data (e.g., JSON) and converts it into Python objects.  

```python
from .serializers import MenuItemSerializer

# Example: Serializing multiple menu items
serialized_item = MenuItemSerializer(items, many=True)

# Return the serialized data in a response
return Response(serialized_item.data)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Validate the Serialized Data
- Use the `is_valid()` method of the serializer to validate the data
```python 
from .serializers import MenuItemSerializer

# Example: Validating the serialized data
serializer = MenuItemSerializer(data=request.data)  # Pass the client-provided data
if serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True):  # Validate the data and raise an error if invalid
    # Perform additional logic here (e.g., saving the validated data)
    serializer.save()
```

# üìù `read_only` and `write_only` Properties in Deserialization

When working with Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers, you can use the `read_only` and `write_only` attributes to control how fields are handled during serialization and deserialization.

---

## üí° What is `read_only`?  
Fields marked as `read_only` are included in the serialized output but **cannot** be used in the deserialization process (e.g., when creating or updating data).

### Example:
Imagine a scenario where an `id` field should only be included in the **response**, not in the **request**.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers

class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    id = serializers.IntegerField(read_only=True)  # This field is read-only
    name = serializers.CharField()
    price = serializers.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
```
- When reading (serialization): `id` is included in the output.
- When writing (deserialization): `id` is ignored.

```json 
# Serialized output (response)
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Pizza",
    "price": 10.99
}

# Deserialized input (request)
{
    "name": "Burger",
    "price": 8.99
}
```

# üìù `read_only` and `write_only` Properties in Deserialization

When working with Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers, you can use the `read_only` and `write_only` attributes to control how fields are handled during serialization and deserialization.

---

## üí° What is `read_only`?  
= Fields marked as `read_only` are included in the serialized output but **cannot** be used in the deserialization process (e.g., when creating or updating data).

### Example:
Imagine a scenario where an `id` field should only be included in the response, not in the request.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers

class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    id = serializers.IntegerField(read_only=True)  # This field is read-only
    name = serializers.CharField()
    price = serializers.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
```
Usage:
- When reading (serialization): id is included in the output.
- When writing (deserialization): id is ignored.
```python
# Serialized output (response)
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Pizza",
    "price": 10.99
}

# Deserialized input (request)
{
    "name": "Burger",
    "price": 8.99
}
```

üí° What is write_only?
- Fields marked as `write_only` are used during deserialization (e.g., input data from a request) but not included in the serialized output.
### Example:
Imagine a password field that should only be used when creating or updating an object, not when retrieving it.
```python 
from rest_framework import serializers

class UserSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    username = serializers.CharField()
    password = serializers.CharField(write_only=True)  # This field is write-only

```
Usage:
- When reading (serialization): password is excluded.
- When writing (deserialization): password is included.

## üõ† Combined Example: Using read_only and write_only Together
```python 
from rest_framework import serializers

class ProductSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    id = serializers.IntegerField(read_only=True)  # Automatically generated, not user-input
    name = serializers.CharField()
    price = serializers.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    secret_code = serializers.CharField(write_only=True)  # Used for special operations, hidden in responses
```
- Input (Deserialization):
```json 
{
    "name": "Laptop",
    "price": 999.99,
    "secret_code": "special123"
}

```
- Output (Serialization):
```json
{
    "id": 42,
    "name": "Laptop",
    "price": 999.99
}

```
