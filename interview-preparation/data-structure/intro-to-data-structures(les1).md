# Introduction to Data Structures 📊

## What is a Data Structure? 🤔
A **data structure** is a way to organize, store, and manage data efficiently. It defines how data is arranged in memory and how operations (such as retrieval, insertion, and deletion) are performed.

### Data Structure as a First-Class Object 🏆
A data structure is considered a **first-class object**, meaning:
- It can be **passed** to a function as an argument.
- It can be **returned** from a function.
- It can be **assigned** to a variable and generally treated like any other variable.

## Types of Data Structures 🔢
Data structures can be broadly classified into two types:

### 1️⃣ Linear Data Structures 📏
- **Definition**: Data is arranged in a sequential order.
- **Examples**:
  - **Arrays**: Fixed-size collection of elements.
  - **Linked Lists**: Nodes connected via pointers.
  - **Stacks**: Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
  - **Queues**: Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

### 2️⃣ Non-Linear Data Structures 🌳
- **Definition**: Data is arranged in a hierarchical or non-sequential manner.
- **Examples**:
  - **Trees**: A hierarchical structure where each node has child nodes.
  - **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
  - **Hash Tables**: Stores key-value pairs for quick lookup.

## Parsing a String 📝
**Parsing** a string means analyzing its contents to extract useful information, often following a specific format. The purposes include:
- Breaking down a string into structured components.
- Converting data into a usable format.
- Processing strings based on patterns (e.g., removing specific characters, extracting numbers, etc.).

## Primitive Data Types 📏
### Integer (int) Representation 🧮
- A **primitive int** is typically represented using **4 bytes (32 bits)**.
- Some systems may allow 8-byte (64-bit) integers, but 4 bytes is the standard size.

### Boolean Values 🔘
A **Boolean** variable can hold two possible values:
- **True or False** (in high-level languages like Python and JavaScript).
- **0 or 1** (common in lower-level programming and binary logic).

## Copying an Array 📋
Copying an array can be done in two ways:
1. **Shallow Copy** 🏕️
   - Copies references to the original elements, not the actual elements.
   - Changes in one array affect the other.
2. **Deep Copy** 🏞️
   - Creates a completely independent copy with new memory allocation.
   - Changes in one array do **not** affect the other.

## Mutable vs Immutable Data Structures 🔄

### ✅ Mutable (Can be Changed)
- **Definition**: These data structures allow modification after creation.
- **Examples**:
  - Lists (`list` in Python)
  - Dictionaries (`dict` in Python)
  - Sets (`set` in Python)

### ❌ Immutable (Cannot be Changed)
- **Definition**: Once created, their values cannot be altered.
- **Examples**:
  - Strings (`str` in Python)
  - Tuples (`tuple` in Python)
  - Frozen Sets (`frozenset` in Python)

## Why are Data Structures Important? 🏗️
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes time and space complexity.
- **Scalability**: Helps handle large datasets.
- **Code Organization**: Makes programs easier to manage and maintain.
- **Real-world Applications**: Used in databases, networking, AI, and more.

Understanding data structures is fundamental to becoming a proficient programmer! 🚀
