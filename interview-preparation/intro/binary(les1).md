# Working in Binary 🖥️

## Introduction 🧠
Computers process data using binary (0s and 1s). Boolean logic, truth tables, and logic gates enable complex operations through simple on/off states.

## Boolean Logic 🔢
Boolean logic uses two states: **True (1)** and **False (0)**. The primary Boolean functions are:

1. **NOT (¬X)** ➝ Inverts the input.
2. **OR (X + Y)** ➝ Returns 1 if either X or Y is 1.
3. **AND (X ⋅ Y)** ➝ Returns 1 only if both X and Y are 1. (if x and y are different)
4. **XOR (X ⊕ Y)** ➝ Returns 1 if X and Y are different.

## Programatically 💻
- **Not** ➝ `( !X )`
- **OR** ➝ `( X || Y )`
- **AND** ➝ `( X && Y )`
- **XOR** ➝ `( X ^ Y )`

## Truth Tables 📊
Each Boolean function can be represented in a truth table:

### **NOT Gate**
| X | NOT(X) |
|---|--------|
| 0 | 1      |
| 1 | 0      |

### **OR Gate**
| X | Y | X + Y |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 1     |

### **AND Gate**
| X | Y | X ⋅ Y |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 0     |
| 1 | 0 | 0     |
| 1 | 1 | 1     |

### **XOR Gate**
| X | Y | X ⊕ Y |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 0     |
| 0 | 1 | 1     |
| 1 | 0 | 1     |
| 1 | 1 | 0     |

## Logic Gates ⚡
Logic gates are the building blocks of circuits. They process inputs (0s and 1s) to generate Boolean outputs.

| Gate  | Symbol | Function |
|-------|--------|----------|
| NOT   | ¬X     | Inverts input |
| OR    | X + Y  | Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1 |
| AND   | X ⋅ Y  | Outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1 |
| XOR   | X ⊕ Y  | Outputs 1 if inputs are different |

## Applications 🏗️
- **Circuits & Processors**: Digital circuits use gates to perform computations.
- **Programming**: Boolean logic is used in conditional statements.
- **Search Algorithms**: Boolean operations help refine searches.

Understanding binary and Boolean logic is essential for computing and electronics. 🚀
