# ðŸ’¡ it`s an another way to write views using OOP

# class based view VS function based view :->

def function_view(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        # view logic
        return HttpResponse("")


class class_view:
    def get(self, request):
        # view logic
        return HttpResponse("")
