# ðŸ“‘ Model

- A model represents the structure of your database.
- Models replace custom SQL queries.
- Each model in Django corresponds to a table in the database.

# ðŸ“‘ Note

- Django automatically creates a database table for each model.
- Each model attribute represents a database field.
- Django handles the primary key automatically, but you can override it.
- You can't create a database only by defining the model class; you need to use **migrations**.

# Some Model Methods

   Example: `new_user.save()`

2. `get()`: Retrieves the model instance from the database (Read)  
   Example: `user = User.objects.get(id=1)`

3. `update()`: Updates the model instance in the database (Update)

4. `delete()`: Deletes the model instance from the database (Delete)
