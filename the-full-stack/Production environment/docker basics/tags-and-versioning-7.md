# Docker Tags, Versioning, and Pushing to Docker Hub 🚀

Docker tags are **labels** for your app's image versions. They help you organize, identify, and deploy specific versions easily. Let’s break it down! 😎

---

## What Are Docker Tags? 🏷️

Docker tags act as version names for your images:
- `myapp:latest` → Most recent version
- `myapp:v1.0` → Version 1.0
- `myapp:dev` → Development version

## How to Tag Versions 🛠️

### Example: Pizza Shop 🍕
Imagine a pizza shop website with:
1. **First version**: Shows the menu → `pizza-shop:v1.0`
2. **Second version**: Adds online ordering → `pizza-shop:v2.0`

Mark version 2 as the `latest` version:
```bash
docker tag pizza-shop:v2.0 pizza-shop:latest
docker push pizza-shop:latest
```
This makes `latest` point to version 2, so pulling `pizza-shop:latest` gives version 2.

## Push Images to Docker Hub 🌐

1. **Log in to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```
   Enter your Docker Hub username and password.

2. **Tag the Image with Your Repository Name**:
   Replace `your-username` with your Docker Hub username:
   ```bash
   docker tag pizza-shop:v2.0 your-username/pizza-shop:v2.0
   ```

3. **Push the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker push your-username/pizza-shop:v2.0
   ```
   Now your image is available on Docker Hub! 🎉

4. **Push `latest` Tag (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   docker tag pizza-shop:v2.0 your-username/pizza-shop:latest
   docker push your-username/pizza-shop:latest
   ```
   This makes `latest` the default version users get when pulling your image.

## Best Practices 🏆

1. **Use Semantic Versioning**: 
   - Format: `major.minor.patch` (e.g., `v1.0.1` for a patch).
   ```bash
   docker build -t pizza-shop:v1.1.0 .
   ```

2. **Tag `latest` for Stable Releases Only**:
   ```bash
   docker tag pizza-shop:v2.0 pizza-shop:latest
   docker push pizza-shop:latest
   ```

3. **Separate Environments**:
   - Use tags like `dev`, `staging`, `prod`.
   ```bash
   docker build -t pizza-shop:dev .
   ```

4. **Clean Up Regularly**: Free space by removing unused images:
   ```bash
   docker image prune
   ```

## Key Commands Cheat Sheet 📝

| Command                              | Purpose                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `docker build -t name:tag .`         | Build an image with a tag         |
| `docker tag imageID name:tag`        | Add a tag to an existing image    |
| `docker push name:tag`               | Push an image to a registry       |
| `docker pull name:tag`               | Pull a specific version of an image |
| `docker image prune`                 | Clean up unused images            |
