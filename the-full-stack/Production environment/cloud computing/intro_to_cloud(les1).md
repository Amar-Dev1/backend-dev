## üåê Types of Cloud Computing

### 1. **Public Cloud**
A public cloud is a cloud environment owned and managed by a third-party provider. Resources are shared among multiple customers. Examples include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Ideal for:
- Businesses seeking scalability and cost efficiency.
- Non-sensitive workloads.

### 2. **Private Cloud**
A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, offering enhanced security and control. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider. Ideal for:
- Organizations with strict data security or compliance requirements.
- Custom workloads.

### 3. **Hybrid Cloud**
A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between them. This offers greater flexibility and optimization of existing infrastructure. Ideal for:
- Businesses needing scalability while maintaining sensitive workloads privately.

## üí° Service Models of Cloud Computing

### **1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking.
- Full control over the infrastructure.
- Examples: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, DigitalOcean.

### **2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- Offers a platform to develop, test, and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure.
- Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### **3. Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- Delivers software applications over the internet.
- Users access software on a subscription basis.
- Examples: Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce.

### **4. Database as a Service (DBaaS)**
- Provides managed database solutions with on-demand pricing.
- Reduces the effort to maintain, scale, and optimize databases.
- Examples: AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas, Google Cloud SQL.
